# NeuroGen

NeuroGen is an open-source, extensible, and modular evolution simulator primarily built for self-driving cars. It's based on Unity and written with C#.

It supports persistent storage of genomes using database libraries like [SQLite 3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). The database layer is written in C/C++ as a library, which is imported into the Unity project as a [native plugin](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/NativePlugins.html).

Entire source code is hosted on GitHub in this [repository](https://github.com/MomenaAkhter/neurogen).
